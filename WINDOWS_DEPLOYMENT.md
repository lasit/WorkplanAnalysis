This project provides a **Python source distribution** for Windows deployment. This approach avoids cross-platform executable compatibility issues and provides a reliable way to run the Workplan Analysis application on Windows 11.

## 📦 What's Available

- **`dist/WorkplanAnalysis-Python.zip`** (35KB) - Complete Python distribution
- **`create_python_distribution.py`** - Script to regenerate the distribution

## 🚀 For Windows 11 Users

### Step 1: Download and Extract
1. Download `WorkplanAnalysis-Python.zip`
2. Extract to your desired location (e.g., Desktop)

### Step 2: Install Python (One-time setup)
1. Go to https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download Python 3.8 or later
3. **IMPORTANT**: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
4. Restart your computer after installation

### Step 3: Install Application
1. Open the extracted folder
2. Double-click `install.bat`
3. Wait for dependencies to install

### Step 4: Run Application
- Double-click `run_app.bat` to start the application
- OR open Command Prompt and run: `python main.py`

## 📋 What's Included in the Distribution

```
WorkplanAnalysis-Python/
├── main.py                    # Application entry point
├── requirements.txt           # Python dependencies
├── install.bat               # Windows installation script
├── run_app.bat               # Windows run script
├── README_WINDOWS.txt        # Detailed user instructions
├── core/                     # Core application modules

└── sample_resources.yml      # Sample configuration
```

## ✅ Advantages of This Approach

- **Small Download**: 35KB vs 646MB for executable
- **No Compatibility Issues**: Pure Python runs on any Windows version
- **Easy Troubleshooting**: Can see error messages directly
- **Easy Updates**: Just replace Python files
- **Reliable**: No cross-platform executable problems

## 🔄 Regenerating the Distribution

To create a new distribution package:

```bash
python3 create_python_distribution.py
```

This will create a fresh `dist/WorkplanAnalysis-Python.zip` with all current files.

## 🛠️ For Developers

The `create_python_distribution.py` script:
- Copies all necessary Python source files
- Includes sample data files
- Creates Windows batch scripts for easy installation/running
- Generates comprehensive user instructions
- Packages everything into a ZIP file

## 📞 Support

If users encounter issues:
1. Ensure Python is properly installed with PATH
2. Check that `install.bat` ran successfully
3. Try running `python main.py` from Command Prompt to see error messages
4. Verify all sample files are present in the folder
